# ASU-Random-Club-Info

## Intro

This repository is for general information regarding student organizations (clubs) at ASU (Arizona State University)

## Structure

Structure notes and docs using directories. For example, `/general/room-reservation-system.md`

Make sure your filenames are specific but concise, with words separated by hyphens for legibility. Yeah I know some of you would prefer to use camel case but I just chose hyphens randomly because it is easier to explain to non-CS people. Let's keep things consistent.

Pull requests will be rejected if you use camel case. Sorry! Perhaps someone might create a script in this repo to convert names between camel case and hyphenated to ease the pain for you!
